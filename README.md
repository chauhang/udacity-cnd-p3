# udacity-cnd-p3

Behavior cloning for self driving the car on the Udacity Simulator.

Check out the final videos:

Track1: (The track from which all the training data was collected)

[[Track 1 Video](https://github.com/chauhang/udacity-cnd-p3/blob/master/examples/track1.png)](https://youtu.be/4SNuhUKTq-w)

Track2: (More complex and unseen track)
Amazing to see car driving on this track -- it was more complex and no data from this track was used during training
